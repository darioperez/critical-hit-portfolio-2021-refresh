## About Plug Altermedia.

Plug Altermedia is a multimedia service provider. With headquarters in Dominican Republic and data centers in Brazil, North America and Europe they are the most innovative player in online radio field in Central and South America with their SaaS, Plug Streaming.

<div class="section">

## The Challenge.

Plug Altermedia were struggling providing a separated set of tools working together, but sooner than later this approach became unmanagable and and unscalable.

There was too much manual work in the process and clients had no control over their radios and relied totally on Plug Altermedia even for simplest things such as updating company logo, this was unacceptable.

Plug Altermedia reached me with the idea of building the platform of “tomorrow’s radio, today”.

<div class="section">

## The Solution.

I designed and built an completelly new and integrated platform named Plug Streaming based on most modern tools and standars in low latency audio and video streaming with focus in availability, security and customization.

## The Outcome.

<img class="mb-6" src="/projects-assets/plugstreaming/PlugStreaming - Embeddable Player.png" />

They wanted their platform to be available on every major device so I built a serie of live streaming native and web players that are available from traditional PCs, smartphones, smartwatches to even a modern refrigerator so radio listeners have always access to their favorite live radio streamings.

  </div>
</div>

Remember that radio stations needed to talk to Plug Altermedia for even the most simple changes to be manually made in their live streaming players? Well, I build a totally automanagable radio station control panel where customers are able to fully manage and customize their live streaming players.

<div class="section ch-project__outcome">
<img class="mb-6" src="/projects-assets/plugstreaming/PlugStreaming - Features.png" />

The players are always providing meaningful and useful information to the listeners. The players able to intelligently identify which show or sponsor is on air, what song is playing and to pull song, album, artist and cover from music streaming services such as Spotify Google Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, among others and customize its appeareance based con album cover.

I integrated socia media and blogs into the player so listener can check latest info from their favorite radio stations. In addition I added a realtime chat where listeners and show staff can interact in realtime.
