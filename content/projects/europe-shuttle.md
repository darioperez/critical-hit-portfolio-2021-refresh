<div class="section">

## The Challenge.

Europe Shuttle provides their transfer services to 97 countries in all types of vehicles, from sedans to minibuses. And no only transfer services but also total custom and exclusive experiences such as chasing after any of the 150 Pokémons. Europe Shuttle’s previous brand was outdated and wasn’t representing the value and vision of the company, on the other hand their reservation process for B2C public was a painful experience making difficult, and sometimes even impossible, for customers to place reservations.

<div class="section mb-20">

## The Solution.

We directed an in-depth master and customer research to determine how customers were perceiving the brand and based on it traced a plan to improve Europe Shuttle’s presence.

In order to improve their B2C experience we redesigned their reservation process and defined a strategy and provided mentoring to their in-house team to implement the new solution.
